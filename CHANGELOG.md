All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fix bug where `PretrainedTransformerTokenizer` crashed with some transformers (#4267)
- Make `cached_path` work offline.
- Tons of docstring inconsistencies resolved.
- Nightly builds no longer run on forks.
- Distributed training now automatically figures out which worker should see which instances
- A race condition bug in distributed training caused from saving the vocab to file from the master process while other processing might be reading those files.
- Unused dependencies in `setup.py` removed.

### Added

- Additional CI checks to ensure docstrings are consistently formatted.
- Ability to train on CPU with multiple processes by setting `cuda_devices` to a list of negative integers in your training config. For example: `"distributed": {"cuda_devices": [-1, -1]}`. This is mainly to make it easier to test and debug distributed training code..
- Documentation for when parameters don't need config file entries.

### Changed

- The `allennlp test-install` command now just ensures the core submodules can
be imported successfully, and prints out some other useful information such as the version, PyTorch version,
and the number of GPU devices available.
- All of the tests moved from `allennlp/tests` to `tests` at the root level, and
`allennlp/tests/fixtures` moved to `test_fixtures` at the root level. The PyPI source and wheel distributions will no longer include tests and fixtures.
