## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Make `cached_path` work offline.
- Tons of docstring inconsistencies resolved.
- Nightly builds no longer run on forks.
- Distributed training now automatically figures out which worker should see which instances

### Added

- Additional CI checks to ensure docstrings are consistently formatted.

### Changed

- The `allennlp test-install` command now just ensures the core submodules can
be imported successfully, and prints out some other useful information such as the version, PyTorch version,
and the number of GPU devices available.
- All of the tests moved from `allennlp/tests` to `tests` at the root level, and
`allennlp/tests/fixtures` moved to `test_fixtures` at the root level. The PyPI source and wheel distributions will no longer include tests and fixtures.
