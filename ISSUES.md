# Issue Management

We maintain one person on-call per week.  We rotate between Joel, Mark, Matt G, and Michael.  This person has the responsibility to triage all untriaged issues at least once per day.
To triage an issue, one of the following priority tags are assigned.

* **P1**: This issue is more important than in-progress work.  It will be assigned an owner and addressed immediately.
* **P2**: This issue is urgent and important.  We will determine whether it is more important than current work at the next bi-weekly issue triage.
* **P3**: This issue would be good to address, but is not urgent.  We will revisit it at the next quarter.
* Closed: We donâ€™t plan to address this, and are closing the issue.
