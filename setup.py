In order to create a package for pypi, you need to follow several steps.

1. Create a .pypirc in your home directory. It should look like this:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  pypitest

[pypi]
username=allennlp
password= Get the password from LastPass.

[pypitest]
repository=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username=allennlp
password= Get the password from LastPass.
```
run chmod 600 ./pypirc so only you can read/write.

1. Change the version in docs/conf.py and setup.py.

2. Commit these changes with the message: "Release: VERSION"

3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: "git tag VERSION -m'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' "
   Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin master

4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between
   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).

   For the wheel, run: "python setup.py bdist_wheel" in the top level allennlp directory.
   (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it - make sure you use python 3.x).

   For the sources, run: "python setup.py sdist"
   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions of allennlp.

5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:

   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest
   (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.)

   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:
   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi allennlp

6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:
   twine upload dist/* -r pypi

7. Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.
