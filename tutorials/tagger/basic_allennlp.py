<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to AllenNLP! This tutorial will walk you through the basics of building and training an AllenNLP model.</p>
 {% include more-tutorials.html %}
 <p>Before we get started, make sure you have a clean Python 3.6 or 3.7 virtual environment, and then run the following command to install the AllenNLP library:</p>
 {% highlight bash %}
pip install allennlp
{% endhighlight %}
 <hr />
 <p>In this tutorial we'll implement a slightly enhanced version of the PyTorch
<a href = "https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html#example-an-lstm-for-part-of-speech-tagging">LSTM for Part-of-Speech Tagging</a> tutorial,
adding some features that make it a slightly more realistic task (and that also showcase some of the benefits of AllenNLP):</p>
 <ol class="formatted">
  <li>We'll read our data from files. (The tutorial example uses data that's given as part of the Python code.)</li>
  <li>We'll use a separate validation dataset to check our performance. (The tutorial example trains and evaluates on the same dataset.)</li>
  <li>We'll use <a href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm" target="_blank">tqdm</a> to track the progress of our training.</li>
  <li>We'll implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping" target="_blank">early stopping</a> based on the loss on the validation dataset.</li>
  <li>We'll track accuracy on both the training and validation sets as we train the model.</li>
</ol>
 <p>(In addition to what's highlighted in this tutorial, AllenNLP provides many other "for free" features.)
 <hr />
 <h2>The Problem</h2>
 <p>Given a sentence (e.g. <code>"The dog ate the apple"</code>) we want to predict part-of-speech tags for each word<br />(e.g <code>["DET", "NN", "V", "DET", "NN"]</code>).</p>
 <p>As in the PyTorch tutorial, we'll embed each word in a low-dimensional space, pass them through an LSTM to get a sequence of encodings, and use a feedforward layer to transform those into a sequence of logits (corresponding to the possible part-of-speech tags).</p>
 <p>Below is the annotated code for accomplishing this. You can start reading the annotations from the top, or just look through the code and look to the annotations when you need more explanation.</p>
 <!-- Annotated Code -->
"""
#### In AllenNLP we use type annotations for just about everything.
from typing import Iterator, List, Dict

#### AllenNLP is built on top of PyTorch, so we use its code freely.
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

#### In AllenNLP we represent each training example as an 
#### <code>Instance</code> containing <code>Field</code>s of various types. 
#### Here each example will have a <code>TextField</code> containing the sentence, 
#### and a <code>SequenceLabelField</code> containing the corresponding part-of-speech tags.
from allennlp.data import Instance
from allennlp.data.fields import TextField, SequenceLabelField

#### Typically to solve a problem like this using AllenNLP, 
#### you'll have to implement two classes. The first is a 
#### <a href ="https://allenai.github.io/allennlp-docs/api/allennlp.data.dataset_readers.html">DatasetReader</a>, 
#### which contains the logic for reading a file of data and producing a stream of <code>Instance</code>s.
from allennlp.data.dataset_readers import DatasetReader

#### Frequently we'll want to load datasets or models from URLs. 
#### The <code>cached_path</code> helper downloads such files, 
#### caches them locally, and returns the local path. It also 
#### accepts local file paths (which it just returns as-is).
from allennlp.common.file_utils import cached_path

#### There are various ways to represent a word as one or more indices. 
#### For example, you might maintain a vocabulary of unique words and 
#### give each word a corresponding id. Or you might have one id per 
#### character in the word and represent each word as a sequence of ids. 
#### AllenNLP uses a has a <code>TokenIndexer</code> abstraction for this representation.
from allennlp.data.token_indexers import TokenIndexer, SingleIdTokenIndexer
from allennlp.data.tokenizers import Token

#### Whereas a <code>TokenIndexer</code> represents a rule for 
#### how to turn a token into indices, a <code>Vocabulary</code> 
#### contains the corresponding mappings from strings to integers. 
#### For example, your token indexer might specify to represent a 
#### token as a sequence of character ids, in which case the 
#### <code>Vocabulary</code> would contain the mapping {character -> id}. 
#### In this particular example we use a <code>SingleIdTokenIndexer</code> 
#### that assigns each token a unique id, and so the <code>Vocabulary</code> 
#### will just contain a mapping {token -> id} (as well as the reverse mapping).
from allennlp.data.vocabulary import Vocabulary

#### Besides <code>DatasetReader</code>, the other class you'll typically 
#### need to implement is <code>Model</code>, which is a PyTorch <code>Module</code> 
#### that takes tensor inputs and produces a dict of tensor outputs 
#### (including the training <code>loss</code> you want to optimize).
from allennlp.models import Model

#### As mentioned above, our model will consist of an embedding layer,
#### followed by a LSTM, then by a feedforward layer. AllenNLP includes 
#### abstractions for all of these that smartly handle padding and batching, 
#### as well as various utility functions.
from allennlp.modules.text_field_embedders import TextFieldEmbedder, BasicTextFieldEmbedder
from allennlp.modules.token_embedders import Embedding
from allennlp.modules.seq2seq_encoders import Seq2SeqEncoder, PytorchSeq2SeqWrapper
from allennlp.nn.util import get_text_field_mask, sequence_cross_entropy_with_logits

#### We'll want to track accuracy on the training and validation datasets.
from allennlp.training.metrics import CategoricalAccuracy

#### In our training we'll need a <code>DataIterator</code>s that can intelligently batch our data.
from allennlp.data.iterators import BucketIterator

#### And we'll use AllenNLP's full-featured <code>Trainer</code>.
from allennlp.training.trainer import Trainer

#### Finally, we'll want to make predictions on new inputs, more about this below.
from allennlp.predictors import SentenceTaggerPredictor

torch.manual_seed(1)

#### Our first order of business is to implement our <code>DatasetReader</code> subclass.
class PosDatasetReader(DatasetReader):
    """
    DatasetReader for PoS tagging data, one sentence per line, like

        The###DET dog###NN ate###V the###DET apple###NN
    """
    #### The only parameter our <code>DatasetReader</code> needs is a dict of 
    #### <code>TokenIndexer</code>s that specify how to convert tokens into indices. 
    #### By default we'll just generate a single index for each token (which we'll call "tokens") 
    #### that's just a unique id for each distinct token. (This is just the standard 
    #### "word to index" mapping you'd use in most NLP tasks.)
    def __init__(self, token_indexers: Dict[str, TokenIndexer] = None) -> None:
        super().__init__(lazy=False)
        self.token_indexers = token_indexers or {"tokens": SingleIdTokenIndexer()}

    #### <code>DatasetReader.text_to_instance</code> takes the inputs corresponding
    #### to a training example (in this case the tokens of the sentence and the
    #### corresponding part-of-speech tags), instantiates the corresponding
    #### <a href="https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/tutorials/notebooks/data_pipeline.ipynb"><code>Field</code>s</a>
    #### (in this case a <code>TextField</code> for the sentence and a <code>SequenceLabelField</code> 
    #### for its tags), and returns the <code>Instance</code> containing those fields.
    #### Notice that the tags are optional, since we'd like to be able to create instances 
    #### from unlabeled data to make predictions on them.
    def text_to_instance(self, tokens: List[Token], tags: List[str] = None) -> Instance:
        sentence_field = TextField(tokens, self.token_indexers)
        fields = {"sentence": sentence_field}

        if tags:
            label_field = SequenceLabelField(labels=tags, sequence_field=sentence_field)
            fields["labels"] = label_field

        return Instance(fields)

    #### The other piece we have to implement is <code>_read</code>, 
    #### which takes a filename and produces a stream of <code>Instance</code>s.
    #### Most of the work has already been done in <code>text_to_instance</code>.
    def _read(self, file_path: str) -> Iterator[Instance]:
        with open(file_path) as f:
            for line in f:
                pairs = line.strip().split()
                sentence, tags = zip(*(pair.split("###") for pair in pairs))
                yield self.text_to_instance([Token(word) for word in sentence], tags)

#### The other class you'll basically always have to implement is <code>Model</code>,
#### which is a subclass of <code>torch.nn.Module</code>. 
#### How it works is largely up to you, it mostly just needs a <code>forward</code> 
#### method that takes tensor inputs and produces a dict of tensor outputs that 
#### includes the loss you'll use to train the model. As mentioned above, 
#### our model will consist of an embedding layer, a sequence encoder, and a feedforward network.
class LstmTagger(Model):
    #### One thing that might seem unusual is that we're going pass in the embedder and the sequence encoder as constructor parameters. This allows us to experiment with different embedders and encoders without having to change the model code.
    def __init__(self,
                 #### The embedding layer is specified as an AllenNLP <code>TextFieldEmbedder</code>
                 #### which represents a general way of turning tokens into tensors. 
                 #### (Here we know that we want to represent each unique word with a learned tensor, 
                 #### but using the general class allows us to easily experiment with different types
                 #### of embeddings, for example <a href = "https://allennlp.org/elmo">ELMo</a>.)
                 word_embeddings: TextFieldEmbedder,
                 #### Similarly, the encoder is specified as a general <code>Seq2SeqEncoder</code>
                 #### even though we know we want to use an LSTM. Again, this makes it easy to
                 #### experiment with other sequence encoders, for example a Transformer.
                 encoder: Seq2SeqEncoder,
                 #### Every AllenNLP model also expects a <code>Vocabulary</code>,
                 #### which contains the namespaced mappings of tokens to indices and labels to indices.
                 vocab: Vocabulary) -> None:
        #### Notice that we have to pass the vocab to the base class constructor.
        super().__init__(vocab)
        self.word_embeddings = word_embeddings
        self.encoder = encoder
        #### The feed forward layer is not passed in as a parameter, but is constructed by us.
        #### Notice that it looks at the encoder to find the correct input dimension and looks
        #### at the vocabulary (and, in particular, at the label -> index mapping) to find the correct output dimension.
        self.hidden2tag = torch.nn.Linear(in_features=encoder.get_output_dim(),
                                          out_features=vocab.get_vocab_size('labels'))
        #### The last thing to notice is that we also instantiate a 
        #### <code>CategoricalAccuracy</code> metric, which we'll use to track accuracy
        #### during each training and validation epoch.
        self.accuracy = CategoricalAccuracy()

    #### Next we need to implement <code>forward</code>, which is where
    #### the actual computation happens. Each <code>Instance</code> in your dataset
    #### will get (batched with other instances and) fed into <code>forward</code>.
    #### The <code>forward</code> method expects dicts of tensors as input,
    #### and it expects their names to be the names of the fields in your <code>Instance</code>.
    #### In this case we have a sentence field and (possibly) a labels field,
    #### so we'll construct our <code>forward</code> accordingly:
    def forward(self,
                sentence: Dict[str, torch.Tensor],
                labels: torch.Tensor = None) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
        #### AllenNLP is designed to operate on batched inputs, but different input sequences have different lengths.
        #### Behind the scenes AllenNLP is padding the shorter inputs so that the batch has uniform shape,
        #### which means our computations need to use a mask to exclude the padding.
        #### Here we just use the utility function <code>get_text_field_mask</code>,
        #### which returns a tensor of 0s and 1s corresponding to the padded and unpadded locations.
        mask = get_text_field_mask(sentence)
        #### We start by passing the <code>sentence</code> tensor (each sentence a sequence of token ids)
        #### to the <code>word_embeddings</code> module, which converts each sentence into a sequence of embedded tensors.
        embeddings = self.word_embeddings(sentence)
        #### We next pass the embedded tensors (and the mask) to the LSTM, which produces a sequence of encoded outputs.
        encoder_out = self.encoder(embeddings, mask)
        #### Finally, we pass each encoded output tensor to the feedforward layer to produce
        #### logits corresponding to the various tags.
        tag_logits = self.hidden2tag(encoder_out)
        output = {"tag_logits": tag_logits}

        #### As before, the labels were optional, as we might want to run this model
        #### to make predictions on unlabeled data. If we do have labels, then we use
        #### them to update our accuracy metric and compute the "loss" that goes in our output.
        if labels is not None:
            self.accuracy(tag_logits, labels, mask)
            output["loss"] = sequence_cross_entropy_with_logits(tag_logits, labels, mask)

        return output

    #### We included an accuracy metric that gets updated each forward pass.
    #### That means we need to override a <code>get_metrics</code> method that
    #### pulls the data out of it. Behind the scenes, the <code>CategoricalAccuracy</code>
    #### metric is storing the number of predictions and the number of correct predictions,
    #### updating those counts during each call to forward. Each call to get_metric returns
    #### the calculated accuracy and (optionally) resets the counts, which is what allows us
    #### to track accuracy anew for each epoch.
    def get_metrics(self, reset: bool = False) -> Dict[str, float]:
        return {"accuracy": self.accuracy.get_metric(reset)}


#### Now that we've implemented a <code>DatasetReader</code> and <code>Model</code>,
#### we're ready to train. We first need an instance of our dataset reader.
reader = PosDatasetReader()
#### Which we can use to read in the training data and validation data.
#### Here we read them in from a URL, but you could read them in from local files if your data was local.
#### We use <code>cached_path</code> to cache the files locally
#### (and to hand <code>reader.read</code> the path to the local cached version.)
train_dataset = reader.read(cached_path(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allenai/allennlp'
    '/master/tutorials/tagger/training.txt'))
validation_dataset = reader.read(cached_path(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allenai/allennlp'
    '/master/tutorials/tagger/validation.txt'))

#### Once we've read in the datasets, we use them to create our <code>Vocabulary</code>
#### (that is, the mapping[s] from tokens / labels to ids).
vocab = Vocabulary.from_instances(train_dataset + validation_dataset)

#### Now we need to construct the model.
#### We'll choose a size for our embedding layer and for the hidden layer of our LSTM.
EMBEDDING_DIM = 6
HIDDEN_DIM = 6

#### For embedding the tokens we'll just use the <code>BasicTextFieldEmbedder</code>
#### which takes a mapping from index names to embeddings. If you go back to where we
#### defined our <code>DatasetReader</code>, the default parameters included a single
#### index called "tokens", so our mapping just needs an embedding corresponding to that
#### index. We use the <code>Vocabulary</code> to find how many embeddings we need and
#### our <code>EMBEDDING_DIM</code> parameter to specify the output dimension.
#### It's also possible to start with pre-trained embeddings (for example, GloVe vectors),
#### but there's no need to do that on this tiny toy dataset.
token_embedding = Embedding(num_embeddings=vocab.get_vocab_size('tokens'),
                            embedding_dim=EMBEDDING_DIM)
word_embeddings = BasicTextFieldEmbedder({"tokens": token_embedding})
#### We next need to specify the sequence encoder. The need for <code>PytorchSeq2SeqWrapper</code>
#### here is slightly unfortunate
#### (and if you use <a href = "https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/tutorials/tagger/README.md#using-config-files">configuration files</a>
#### you won't need to worry about it) but here it's required to add some extra functionality
#### (and a cleaner interface) to the built-in PyTorch module. In AllenNLP we do everything batch first,
#### so we specify that as well.
lstm = PytorchSeq2SeqWrapper(torch.nn.LSTM(EMBEDDING_DIM, HIDDEN_DIM, batch_first=True))

#### Finally, we can instantiate the model.
model = LstmTagger(word_embeddings, lstm, vocab)

#### Now we're ready to train the model. The first thing we'll need is an optimizer.
#### We can just use PyTorch's stochastic gradient descent.
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

#### And we need a <code>DataIterator</code> that handles batching for our datasets.
#### The <code>BucketIterator</code> sorts instances by the specified fields
#### in order to create batches with similar sequence lengths.
#### Here we indicate that we want to sort the instances by the number of tokens in the sentence field.
iterator = BucketIterator(batch_size=2, sorting_keys=[("sentence", "num_tokens")])
#### We also specify that the iterator should make sure its instances are indexed using our vocabulary;
#### that is, that their strings have been converted to integers using the mapping we previously created.
iterator.index_with(vocab)

#### Now we instantiate our <code>Trainer</code> and run it.
#### Here we tell it to run for 1000 epochs and to stop training early
#### if it ever spends 10 epochs without the validation metric improving.
#### The default validation metric is loss (which improves by getting smaller),
#### but it's also possible to specify a different metric and direction (e.g. accuracy should get bigger).
trainer = Trainer(model=model,
                  optimizer=optimizer,
                  iterator=iterator,
                  train_dataset=train_dataset,
                  validation_dataset=validation_dataset,
                  patience=10,
                  num_epochs=1000)

#### When we launch it it will print a progress bar for each epoch
#### that includes both the "loss" and the "accuracy" metric. 
#### If our model is good, the loss should go down and the accuracy up as we train.
trainer.train()

#### As in the original PyTorch tutorial, we'd like to look at the predictions our model generates.
#### AllenNLP contains a <code>Predictor</code> abstraction that takes inputs,
#### converts them to instances, feeds them through your model,
#### and returns JSON-serializable results. Often you'd need to implement your own Predictor,
#### but AllenNLP already has a <code>SentenceTaggerPredictor</code> that works perfectly here, so we can use it.
#### It requires our model (for making predictions) and a dataset reader (for creating instances).
predictor = SentenceTaggerPredictor(model, dataset_reader=reader)
#### It has a <code>predict</code> method that just needs a sentence and
#### returns (a JSON-serializable version of) the output dict from forward.
#### Here <code>tag_logits</code> will be a (5, 3) array of logits, corresponding 
#### to the 3 possible tags for each of the 5 words.
tag_logits = predictor.predict("The dog ate the apple")['tag_logits']
#### To get the actual "predictions" we can just take the <code>argmax</code>.
tag_ids = np.argmax(tag_logits, axis=-1)
#### And then use our vocabulary to find the predicted tags.
print([model.vocab.get_token_from_index(i, 'labels') for i in tag_ids])

#### Finally, we'd like to be able to save our model and reload it later.
#### We'll need to save two things. The first is the model weights.
# Here's how to save the model.
with open("/tmp/model.th", 'wb') as f:
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), f)
#### And the second is the vocabulary.
vocab.save_to_files("/tmp/vocabulary")

#### We only saved the model weights, so we actually have to recreate the same model structure
#### using code if we want to reuse them.
#### First, let's reload the vocabulary into a new variable.
# And here's how to reload the model.
vocab2 = Vocabulary.from_files("/tmp/vocabulary")
#### And then let's recreate the model (if we were doing this in a different file 
#### we would of course have to re-instantiate the word embeddings and lstm as well).
model2 = LstmTagger(word_embeddings, lstm, vocab2)
#### After which we have to load its state.
with open("/tmp/model.th", 'rb') as f:
    model2.load_state_dict(torch.load(f))

#### And now we should get the same predictions.
predictor2 = SentenceTaggerPredictor(model2, dataset_reader=reader)
tag_logits2 = predictor2.predict("The dog ate the apple")['tag_logits']
assert tag_logits2 == tag_logits

####
"""
<p>
    Although this tutorial has been an explanation of how AllenNLP works,
    in practice you probably wouldn't write your code this way. Most AllenNLP objects
    (Models, DatasetReaders, and so on) can be constructed declaratively
    from JSON-like objects. 
</p>
<p>
    So a more typical use case would involve implementing the Model and
    DatasetReader as above, but creating a <a href = "https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a>
    file indicating how you want to instantiate and train them,
    and then simply using the command line tool <code>allennlp train</code> 
    (which would automatically save an archive of the trained model).
</p>
