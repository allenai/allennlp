    "This notebook introduces how AllenNLP handles one of the key aspects of applying deep learning techniques to textual data: learning distributed representations of words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, there has been an explosion of different techniques to represent words and sentences in NLP, including pre-trained word vectors, character level CNN encodings and sub-word token representation (e.g byte encodings). Even more complex learned representations of higher level lingustic features, such as POS tags, named entities and dependency paths have also proven successful for a wide variety of NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with this breadth of methods for representing words as vectors, AllenNLP introduces 3 key abstractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TokenIndexers`, which generate indexed tensors representing sentences in different ways. See the [Data Pipeline notebook](data_pipeline.ipynb) for more info. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `TokenEmbedders`, which transform indexed tensors into embedded representations. At its most basic, this is just a standard `Embedding` layer you'd find in any neural network library. However, they can be more complex - for instance, AllenNLP has a `token_characters_encoder` which applies a CNN to character level representations.\n",
    "- `TextFieldEmbedders`, which are a wrapper around a set of `TokenEmbedders`. At it's most basic, this applies the `TokenEmbedders` which it is passed and concatenates their output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this hierarchy allows you to easily compose different representations of a sentence together in modular ways. For instance, in the Bidaf model, we use this to concatenate a character level CNN encoding of the words in the sentence to the pretrained word embeddings. You can also specify this completely from a JSON file, making experimenation with different representations extremely easy.\n",
