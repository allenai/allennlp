    Parameters
    ----------
    logits : ``torch.FloatTensor``, required.
        A ``torch.FloatTensor`` of size (batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes)
        which contains the unnormalized probability for each class.
    targets : ``torch.LongTensor``, required.
        A ``torch.LongTensor`` of size (batch, sequence_length) which contains the
        index of the true class for each corresponding step.
    weights : ``torch.FloatTensor``, required.
        A ``torch.FloatTensor`` of size (batch, sequence_length)
    batch_average : bool, optional, (default = None).
        A bool indicating whether the loss should be averaged across the batch,
        or returned as a vector of losses per batch element.

           ``batch_average`` was deprecated and replaced with
           the more general ``average`` in version 0.6.2. It will be removed
           in version 0.8.

    average: str, optional (default = "batch")
        If "batch", average the loss across the batches. If "token", average
        the loss across each item in the input. If ``None``, return a vector
        of losses per batch element.
    label_smoothing : ``float``, optional (default = None)
        Whether or not to apply label smoothing to the cross-entropy loss.
        For example, with a label smoothing value of 0.2, a 4 class classifcation
        target would look like ``[0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.05]`` if the 3rd class was
        the correct label.

    Returns
    -------
    A torch.FloatTensor representing the cross entropy loss.
    If ``average=="batch"`` or ``average=="token"``, the returned loss is a scalar.
    If ``average is None``, the returned loss is a vector of shape (batch_size,).

    This function returns selected values in the target with respect to the provided indices, which
    have size ``(batch_size, d_1, ..., d_n, embedding_size)``. This can use the optionally
    precomputed :func:`~flattened_indices` with size ``(batch_size * d_1 * ... * d_n)`` if given.

    An example use case of this function is looking up the start and end indices of spans in a
    sequence tensor. This is used in the
    :class:`~allennlp.models.coreference_resolution.CoreferenceResolver`. Model to select
    contextual word representations corresponding to the start and end indices of mentions. The key
    reason this can't be done with basic torch functions is that we want to be able to use look-up
    tensors with an arbitrary number of dimensions (for example, in the coref model, we don't know
    a-priori how many spans we are looking up).

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : ``torch.Tensor``, required.
        A 3 dimensional tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_size).

        ``sequence_length`` dimension of the ``target`` tensor.
    flattened_indices : Optional[torch.Tensor], optional (default = None)
        An optional tensor representing the result of calling :func:~`flatten_and_batch_shift_indices`

        cached for many batch lookups.
