    We allow the following kinds of combinations: ``x``, ``x*y``, ``x+y``, ``x-y``, and ``x/y``,

    would be ``[1;2;1*2]``, as you would expect, where ``[;]`` is concatenation along the last
    dimension.

    If you have a fixed, known way to combine tensors that you use in a model, you should probably
