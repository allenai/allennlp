    """
    This class trains a decoder by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the targets.  That is,
    during training, we are given a `set` of acceptable or possible target sequences, and we
    optimize the `sum` of the probability the model assigns to each item in the set.  This allows
    the model to distribute its probability mass over the set however it chooses, without forcing
    `all` of the given target sequences to have high probability.  This is helpful, for example, if
    you have good reason to expect that the correct target sequence is in the set, but aren't sure
    `which` of the sequences is actually correct.

    This implementation of maximum marginal likelihood requires the model you use to be `locally
    normalized`; that is, at each decoding timestep, we assume that the model creates a normalized
    probability distribution over actions.  This assumption is necessary, because we do no explicit
    normalization in our loss function, we just sum the probabilities assigned to all correct
    target sequences, relying on the local normalization at each time step to push probability mass
    from bad actions to good ones.
