class ConstrainedBeamSearch:
    """
    This class implements beam search over transition sequences given an initial ``DecoderState``,
    a ``DecoderStep``, and a list of allowed transition sequences.  We will do a beam search `over
    the list of allowed sequences` and return the highest scoring states found by the beam.  This
    is only actually a `beam search` if your beam size is smaller than the list of allowed
    transition sequences; otherwise, we are just scoring and sorting the sequences using a prefix
    tree.

    The initial ``DecoderState`` is assumed to be `batched`.  The value we return from the search
    is a dictionary from batch indices to ranked finished states.

    IMPORTANT: We assume that the ``DecoderStep`` that you are using returns possible next states
    in sorted order, so we do not do an additional sort inside of
    ``ConstrainedBeamSearch.search()``.  If you're implementing your own ``DecoderStep``, you must
    ensure that you've sorted the states that you return.

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_size : ``int``
        The beam size to use.
    allowed_sequences : ``torch.Tensor``
        A ``(batch_size, num_sequences, sequence_length)`` tensor containing the transition
        sequences that we will search in.  The values in this tensor must match whatever the
        ``DecoderState`` keeps in its ``action_history`` variable (typically this is action
        indices).
    allowed_sequence_mask : ``torch.Tensor``
        A ``(batch_size, num_sequences, sequence_length)`` tensor indicating whether each entry in
        the ``allowed_sequences`` tensor is padding.  The allowed sequences could be padded both on
        the ``num_sequences`` dimension and the ``sequence_length`` dimension.

        Parameters
        ----------
        initial_state : ``DecoderState``
            The starting state of our search.  This is assumed to be `batched`, and our beam search
            is batch-aware - we'll keep ``beam_size`` states around for each instance in the batch.
        decoder_step : ``DecoderStep``
            The ``DecoderStep`` object that defines and scores transitions from one state to the
            next.

        -------
        best_states : ``Dict[int, List[DecoderState]]``
            This is a mapping from batch index to the top states for that instance.
