## Jupyter Notebook Tutorials

This directory contains some Jupyter notebook tutorials for getting familiar with the
library. We recommend that you walk through them in the following order:

1. `Fields`, `Instances` and `Datasets`.
2. [`Vocabularies`](./vocabulary.ipynb) .
3. The NLP API.
4. `Trainers`, `Models` and `Drivers`
5. Running experiments from JSON with AllenNLP.


To launch a tutorial, follow the [install instructions](../../README.md) and then run

```jupyter /path/to/notebook```

Working through these notebooks should provide you with a good understanding of the
way AllenNLP is structured and how you can get the most out of using it. Enjoy!
