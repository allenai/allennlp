class World:
    """
    Base class for defining a world in a new domain. This class defines a method to translate a
    logical form as per a naming convention that works with NLTK's ``LogicParser``. The sub-classes
    can decide on the convention by overriding the ``_map_name`` method that does token level
    mapping. This class also defines methods for transforming logical form strings into parsed
    ``Expressions``, and ``Expressions`` into action sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    constant_type_prefixes : ``Dict[str, BasicType]`` (optional)
        If you have an unbounded number of constants in your domain, you are required to add
        prefixes to their names to denote their types. This is the mapping from prefixes to types.
    global_type_signatures : ``Dict[str, Type]`` (optional)
        A mapping from translated names to their types.
    global_name_mapping : ``Dict[str, str]`` (optional)
        A name mapping from the original names in the domain to the translated names.
    num_nested_lambdas : ``int`` (optional)
        Does the language used in this ``World`` permit lambda expressions?  And if so, how many
        nested lambdas do we need to worry about?  This is important when considering the space of
        all possible actions, which we need to enumerate a priori for the parser.
