class World:
    """
    Base class for defining a world in a new domain. This class defines a method to translate a logical form
    as per a naming convention that works with NLTK's ``LogicParser``. The sub-classes can decide on the
    convention by overriding the ``_map_name`` method that does token level mapping. This class also defines
    methods for transforming logical form strings into parsed ``Expressions``, and ``Expressions`` into
    action sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    constant_type_prefixes : ``Dict[str, BasicType]`` (optional)
        If you have an unbounded number of constants in your domain, you are required to add prefixes to their
        names to denote their types. This is the mapping from prefixes to types.
    global_type_signatures : ``Dict[str, Type]`` (optional)
        A mapping from translated names to their types.
    global_name_mapping : ``Dict[str, str]`` (optional)
        A name mapping from the original names in the domain to the translated names.
