This module defines some classes that are generally useful for defining a type system for a new domain. We
inherit the type logic in ``nltk.sem.logic`` and add some functionality on top of it here. There are two main
improvements:
1) Firstly, we allow defining multiple basic types with their own names (see ``NamedBasicType``).
2) Secondly, we allow defining function types that have placeholders in them (see ``PlaceholderType``).
We also extend NLTK's ``LogicParser`` to define a ``DynamicTypeLogicParser`` that knows how to deal with the
two improvements above.

class PlaceholderType(ComplexType):
    """
    ``PlaceholderType`` is a ``ComplexType`` that involves placeholders, and thus its type resolution is
    context sensitive. This is an abstract class for all placeholder types like reverse, and, or, argmax, etc.

    Note that ANY_TYPE in NLTK's type system doesn't work like a wild card. Once the type of a variable gets
    resolved to a specific type, NLTK changes the type of that variable to that specific type. Hence, what
    NLTK calls "ANY_TYPE", is essentially a "yet-to-be-decided" type. This is a problem because we may want the
    same variable to bind to different types within a logical form, and using ANY_TYPE for this purpose will
    cause a resolution failure. For example the count function may apply to both rows and cells in the same
    logical form, and making count of type ``ComplexType(ANY_TYPE, DATE_NUM_TYPE)`` will cause a resolution
    error. This class lets you define ``ComplexType`` s with placeholders that are actually wild cards.

    The subclasses of this abstract class need to do three things
    1) Override the property ``_signature`` to define the type signature (this is just the signature's
    string representation and will not affect type inference or checking). You will see this signature in
    action sequences.
    2) Override ``resolve`` to resolve the type appropriately (see the docstring in ``resolve`` for more
    information).
    3) Override ``get_application_type`` which returns the return type when this type is applied as a function
    to an argument of a specified type.
    For example, if you defined a reverse type by inheriting from this class, ``get_application_type`` gets an
    argument of type ``<a,b>``, it should return ``<b,a>`` .

        This method is central to type inference and checking. When a variable's type is being checked, we
        compare what we know of its type against what is expected of its type by its context. The expectation
        is provided as ``other``. We make sure that there are no contradictions between this type and other,
        and return an updated type which may be more specific than the original type.

        For example, say this type is of the function variable F in F(cell), and we start out with ``<?, d>``
        (that is, it takes any type and returns ``d`` ). Now we have already resolved cell to be of type
        ``e`` . Then ``resolve`` gets called with ``other = <e, ?>`` , because we know F is a function that
        took a constant of type ``e`` . When we resolve ``<e, ?>`` against ``<?, d>`` , there will not be a
        contradiction, because any type can be successfully resolved against ``?`` . Finally we return
        ``<e, d>`` as the resolved type.

        As a counter example, if we are trying to resolve ``<?, d>`` against ``<?, e>`` , the resolution fails,
        and in that case, this method returns ``None`` .

        Note that a successful resolution does not imply equality of types because of one of them may be
