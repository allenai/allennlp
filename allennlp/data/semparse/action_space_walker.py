class ActionSpaceWalker:
    """
    ``ActionSpaceWalker`` takes a world, traverses all the valid paths driven by the valid action
    specification of the world to generate all possible logical forms (under some constraints). This
    class also has some utilities for indexing logical forms to efficiently retrieve required
    subsets.

    ----------
    world : ``World``
        The world from which valid actions will be taken.
    max_path_length : ``int``
        The maximum path length till which the action space will be explored. Paths longer than this
