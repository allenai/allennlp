    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_dir: `str`
        Path to directory containing `png` image files.
    image_loader: `ImageLoader`
        The image loader component used to load the images.
    image_featurizer: `Lazy[GridEmbedder]`
        The backbone image processor (like a ResNet), whose output will be passed to the region
        detector for finding object boxes in the image.
    region_detector: `Lazy[RegionDetector]`
        For pulling out regions of the image (both coordinates and features) that will be used by
        downstream models.
    answer_vocab: `Union[Vocabulary, str]`, optional
        The vocabulary to use for answers. The reader will look into the `"answers"` namespace
        in the vocabulary to find possible answers.
        If this is given, the reader only outputs instances with answers contained in this vocab.
        If this is not given, the reader outputs all instances with all answers.
        If this is a URL or filename, we will download a previously saved vocabulary from there.
    feature_cache_dir: `Union[str, PathLike]`, optional
        An optional directory to cache the featurized images in. Featurizing images takes a long
        time, and many images are duplicated, so we highly recommend to use this cache.
    tokenizer: `Tokenizer`, optional
        The `Tokenizer` to use to tokenize the text. By default, this uses the tokenizer for
        `"bert-base-uncased"`.
    token_indexers: `Dict[str, TokenIndexer]`, optional
        The `TokenIndexer` to use. By default, this uses the indexer for `"bert-base-uncased"`.
    cuda_device: `Union[int, torch.device]`, optional
        Either a torch device or a GPU number. This is the GPU we'll use to featurize the images.
    max_instances: `int`, optional
        For debugging, you can use this parameter to limit the number of instances the reader
        returns.
    image_processing_batch_size: `int`
        The number of images to process at one time while featurizing. Default is 8.
    multiple_answers_per_question: `bool`
        VQA questions have multiple answers. By default, we use all of them, and give more
        points to the more common answer. But VQA also has a special answer, the so-called
        "multiple choice answer". If this is set to `False`, we only use that answer.
