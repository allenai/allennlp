    # Parameters

    sentences : `List[List[str]]`, required.
        A list of lists representing the tokenised words and sentences in the document.
    token_indexers : `Dict[str, TokenIndexer]`
        This is used to index the words in the document.  See :class:`TokenIndexer`.
    max_span_width : `int`, required.
        The maximum width of candidate spans to consider.
    gold_clusters : `Optional[List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]`, optional (default = None)
        A list of all clusters in the document, represented as word spans with absolute indices
        in the entire document. Each cluster contains some number of spans, which can be nested
        and overlap. If there are exact matches between clusters, they will be resolved
        using `_canonicalize_clusters`.
    wordpiece_modeling_tokenizer: `PretrainedTransformerTokenizer`, optional (default = None)
        If not None, this dataset reader does subword tokenization using the supplied tokenizer
        and distribute the labels to the resulting wordpieces. All the modeling will be based on
        wordpieces. If this is set to `False` (default), the user is expected to use
        `PretrainedTransformerMismatchedIndexer` and `PretrainedTransformerMismatchedEmbedder`,
        and the modeling will be on the word-level.
    max_sentences: int, optional (default = None)
        The maximum number of sentences in each document to keep. By default keeps all sentences.
    remove_singleton_clusters : `bool`, optional (default = True)
        Some datasets contain clusters that are singletons (i.e. no coreferents). This option allows
        the removal of them.

    # Returns

    An `Instance` containing the following `Fields`:
        text : `TextField`
            The text of the full document.
        spans : `ListField[SpanField]`
            A ListField containing the spans represented as `SpanFields`
            with respect to the document text.
        span_labels : `SequenceLabelField`, optional
            The id of the cluster which each possible span belongs to, or -1 if it does
                not belong to a cluster. As these labels have variable length (it depends on
                how many spans we are considering), we represent this a as a `SequenceLabelField`
                with respect to the spans `ListField`.
