def char_span_to_token_span(token_offsets: List[Tuple[int, int]],

    """
    Converts a character span from a passage into the corresponding token span in the tokenized
    version of the passage.  If you pass in a character span that does not correspond to complete
    tokens in the tokenized version, we'll do our best, but the behavior is officially undefined.
    We return an error flag in this case, and have some debug logging so you can figure out the
    cause of this issue (in SQuAD, these are mostly either tokenization problems or annotation
    problems; there's a fair amount of both).

    The basic outline of this method is to find the token span that has the same offsets as the
    input character span.  If the tokenizer tokenized the passage correctly and has matching
    offsets, this is easy.  We try to be a little smart about cases where they don't match exactly,
    but mostly just find the closest thing we can.

    The returned ``(begin, end)`` indices are `inclusive` for both ``begin`` and ``end``.
    So, for example, ``(2, 2)`` is the one word span beginning at token index 2, ``(3, 4)`` is the
    two-word span beginning at token index 3, and so on.

    Returns
    -------
    token_span : ``Tuple[int, int]``
        `Inclusive` span start and end token indices that match as closely as possible to the input
        character spans.
    error : ``bool``
        Whether the token spans match the input character spans exactly.  If this is ``False``, it
        means there was an error in either the tokenization or the annotated character span.
