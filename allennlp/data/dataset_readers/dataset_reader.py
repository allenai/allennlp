    A `DatasetReader` knows how to turn a file containing a dataset into a collection
    of `Instances`.  To implement your own, just override the `_read(file_path)` method
    to return an `Iterable` of the instances. This could be a list containing the instances
    or a lazy generator that returns them one at a time.

    All parameters necessary to _read the data apart from the filepath should be passed
    to the constructor of the `DatasetReader`.

    # Parameters

    lazy : `bool`, optional (default=False)
        If this is true, `instances()` will return an object whose `__iter__` method
        reloads the dataset each time it's called. Otherwise, `instances()` returns a list.
    cache_directory : `str`, optional (default=None)
        If given, we will use this directory to store a cache of already-processed `Instances` in
        every file passed to :func:`read`, serialized (by default, though you can override this) as
        one string-formatted `Instance` per line.  If the cache file for a given `file_path` exists,
        we read the `Instances` from the cache instead of re-processing the data (using
        :func:`_instances_from_cache_file`).  If the cache file does _not_ exist, we will _create_
        it on our first pass through the data (using :func:`_instances_to_cache_file`).
    max_instances : `int`, optional (default=None)
        If given, will stop reading after this many instances. This is a useful setting for debugging.

        IMPORTANT CAVEAT: It is the _caller's_ responsibility to make sure that this directory is
        unique for any combination of code and parameters that you use.  That is, if you pass a
        directory here, we will use any existing cache files in that directory _regardless of the
        parameters you set for this DatasetReader!_
