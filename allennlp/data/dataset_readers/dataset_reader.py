class DatasetReader(Registrable):
    """
    A `DatasetReader` knows how to turn a file containing a dataset into a collection
    of `Instances`.  To implement your own, just override the `_read(file_path)` method
    to return an `Iterable` of the instances. This could be a list containing the instances
    or a lazy generator that returns them one at a time.

    All parameters necessary to `_read` the data apart from the filepath should be passed
    to the constructor of the `DatasetReader`.

    # Parameters

    lazy : `bool`, optional (default=`False`)
        If this is true, `instances()` will return an object whose `__iter__` method
        reloads the dataset each time it's called. Otherwise, `instances()` returns a list.

    cache_directory : `str`, optional (default=`None`)
        If given, we will use this directory to store a cache of already-processed `Instances` in
        every file passed to :func:`read`, serialized (by default, though you can override this) as
        one string-formatted `Instance` per line.  If the cache file for a given `file_path` exists,
        we read the `Instances` from the cache instead of re-processing the data (using
        :func:`_instances_from_cache_file`).  If the cache file does _not_ exist, we will _create_
        it on our first pass through the data (using :func:`_instances_to_cache_file`).

        !!! NOTE
            It is the _caller's_ responsibility to make sure that this directory is
            unique for any combination of code and parameters that you use.  That is, if you pass a
            directory here, we will use any existing cache files in that directory _regardless of the
            parameters you set for this DatasetReader!_

    max_instances : `int`, optional (default=`None`)
        If given, will stop reading after this many instances. This is a useful setting for debugging.
        Setting this disables caching.

    manual_distributed_sharding: `bool`, optional (default=`False`)
        By default, when used in a distributed setting, `DatasetReader` makes sure that each
        worker process only receives a subset of the data. It does this by reading the whole
        dataset in each worker, but filtering out the instances that are not needed. If you
        can implement a faster mechanism that only reads part of the data, set this to True,
        and do the sharding yourself.

    manual_multi_process_sharding : `bool`, optional (default=`False`)
        This is similar to the `manual_distributed_sharding` parameter, but applies to
        multi-process data loading. By default, when this reader is used by a multi-process
        data loader (i.e. a `DataLoader` with `num_workers > 1`), each worker will
        filter out all but a subset of the instances that are needed so that you
        don't end up with duplicates.

        !!! NOTE
            **There is really no benefit of using a multi-process
            `DataLoader` unless you can specifically implement a faster sharding mechanism
            within `_read()`**. In that case you should set `manual_multi_process_sharding`
            to `True`.
