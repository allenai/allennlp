        Does whatever tokenization or processing is necessary to go from textual input to an
        ``Instance``.  The primary intended use for this is with a
        :class:`~allennlp.service.predictors.predictor.Predictor`, which gets text input as a JSON
        object and needs to process it to be input to a model.

        The intent here is to share code between :func:`read` and what happens at
        model serving time, or any other time you want to make a prediction from new data.  We need
        to process the data in the same way it was done at training time.  Allowing the
        ``DatasetReader`` to process new text lets us accomplish this, as we can just call
        ``DatasetReader.text_to_instance`` when serving predictions.

        The input type here is rather vaguely specified, unfortunately.  The ``Predictor`` will
        have to make some assumptions about the kind of ``DatasetReader`` that it's using, in order
        to pass it the right information.
