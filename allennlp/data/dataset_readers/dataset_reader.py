    A ``DatasetReader`` knows how to turn a file containing a dataset into a collection
    of ``Instance`` s.  To implement your own, just override the `_read(file_path)` method
    to return an ``Iterable`` of the instances. This could be a list containing the instances
    or a lazy generator that returns them one at a time.

    All parameters necessary to _read the data apart from the filepath should be passed
    to the constructor of the ``DatasetReader``.

    ----------
    lazy : ``bool``, optional (default=False)
        If this is true, ``instances()`` will return an object whose ``__iter__`` method
        reloads the dataset each time it's called. Otherwise, ``instances()`` returns a list.

        Returns an ``Iterable`` containing all the instances

        If ``self.lazy`` is False, this calls ``self._read()``,
        calls ``ensure_list`` on the result (which is a no-op if
        self._read() returns a list, which most of the existing
        dataset readers do), and returns the resulting list.

        If ``self.lazy`` is True, this returns an object whose
        ``__iter__`` method calls ``self._read()`` each iteration.
        In this case your implementation of ``_read()`` must also be lazy
        (that is, not load all instances into memory at once), otherwise
        you will get a ``ConfigurationError``.

        In either case, the returned ``Iterable`` can be iterated

        Does whatever tokenization or processing is necessary to go from textual input to an

        object and needs to process it to be input to a model.

        model serving time, or any other time you want to make a prediction from new data.  We need
        to process the data in the same way it was done at training time.  Allowing the
        ``DatasetReader`` to process new text lets us accomplish this, as we can just call
        ``DatasetReader.text_to_instance`` when serving predictions.

        The input type here is rather vaguely specified, unfortunately.  The ``Predictor`` will
        have to make some assumptions about the kind of ``DatasetReader`` that it's using, in order
