class IndexField(Field[numpy.ndarray]):
    """
    An ``IndexField`` is an optional index into a :class:`SequenceField`, as might be used for
    representing a correct answer option in a list, or a span begin and span end position in a
    passage, for example.  Because it's an index into a :class:`SequenceField`, we take one of
    those as input and use it to compute padding lengths, so we create an optional one-hot
    representation of the correct length. As the index is optional, this Field can be used as
    a binary indicator for inputs which are optional.

    An ``IndexField`` will get converted into a one-hot vector, where the size of the vector is the
    number of elements in the dependent ``SequenceField``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : ``Optional[int]``
        The index to be represented as a 1 in the one-hot vector.  This is typically the "correct
        answer" in some classification decision over the sequence, like where an answer span starts
        in SQuAD, or which answer option is correct in a multiple choice question. If the index is
        is ``None``, an array of all zeros is returned.
    sequence_field : ``SequenceField``
        A field containing the sequence that this ``IndexField`` is a pointer into.
