    A very basic iterator, which takes a dataset, creates fixed sized batches,
    and pads all of the instances in a batch to the maximum lengths of the relevant fields
    within that batch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch_size : int, optional, (default = 32)
        The size of each batch of instances yielded when calling the iterator.
    instances_per_epoch : int, optional, (default = None)
        If specified, each epoch will consist of precisely this many instances.
        If not specified, each epoch will consist of a single pass through the dataset.
    max_instances_in_memory : int, optional, (default = None)
        If specified, the iterator will load this many instances at a time into an
        in-memory list and then produce batches from one such list at a time. This
        could be useful if your instances are read lazily from disk.
