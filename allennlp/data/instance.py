class Instance(Mapping[str, Field]):
    """
    An ``Instance`` is a collection of :class:`~allennlp.data.fields.field.Field` objects,
    specifying the inputs and outputs to
    some model.  We don't make a distinction between inputs and outputs here, though - all
    operations are done on all fields, and when we return arrays, we return them as dictionaries
    keyed by field name.  A model can then decide which fields it wants to use as inputs as which
    as outputs.

    The ``Fields`` in an ``Instance`` can start out either indexed or un-indexed.  During the data
    processing pipeline, all fields will be indexed, after which multiple instances can be combined
    into a ``Batch`` and then converted into padded arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fields : ``Dict[str, Field]``
        The ``Field`` objects that will be used to produce data arrays for this instance.
