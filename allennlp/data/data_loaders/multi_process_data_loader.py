@DataLoader.register("multi_process")
class MultiProcessDataLoader(DataLoader):
    """
    The `MultiProcessDataLoader` is a [`DataLoader`](../data_loader/#dataloader)
    that's optimized for AllenNLP experiments.
    Unlike the [`PyTorchDataLoader`](../pytorch_data_loader/#pytorchdataloader),
    it can efficiently utilize multiple workers and always allows you to use a
    [`BatchSampler`](../../samplers/batch_sampler/#batchsampler).

    See
    [Using your reader with multi-process or distributed data loading](/api/data/dataset_readers/dataset_reader/#datasetreader.using_your_reader_with_multi-process_or_distributed_data_loading)
    for more information on how to optimize your `DatasetReader`.

    # Parameters

    reader: `DatasetReader`, required
        A `DatasetReader` used to load instances from the `data_path`.

    data_path: `str`, required
        Passed to `DatasetReader.read()`.

    batch_size: `int`, optional (default = `None`)
        When `batch_sampler` is unspecified, this option can be combined with `drop_last`
        and `shuffle` to control automatic batch sampling.

    drop_last: `bool`, optional (default = `False`)
        When `batch_sampler` is unspecified, this option can be combined with `batch_size`
        and `shuffle` to control automatic batch sampling.

        If `True`, the last batch will be dropped it doesn't contain a full `batch_size`
        number of `Instance`s.

    shuffle: `bool`, optional (default = `False`)
        When `batch_sampler` is unspecified, this option can be combined with `batch_size`
        and `drop_last` to control automatic batch sampling.

    batch_sampler: `BatchSampler`, optional (default = `None`)
        A `BatchSampler` to handle batching. This option is mutually exclusive with
        `batch_size`, `drop_last`, and `shuffle`.

    batches_per_epoch: `int`, optional (default = `None`)
        If specified, exactly `batches_per_epoch` batches will be generated with each call
        to `__iter__()`.

    num_workers: `int`, optional (default = `0`)
        The number of workers to use to read `Instance`s in parallel.
        If `num_workers = 0`, everything is done in the main process. Otherwise `num_workers`
        workers are forked or spawned (depending on the value of `start_method`), each of which
        calls `read()` on their copy of the `reader`.

        This means that in order for multi-process loading to be efficient when `num_workers > 1`,
        the `reader` needs to implement
        [`manual_multi_process_sharding`](/api/data/dataset_readers/dataset_reader/#datasetreader).

    collate_fn: `Callable[[List[Instance]], TensorDict]`, optional (default = `allennlp_collate`)
        The function used to turn `Instance`s into a `TensorDict` batch.

    max_instances_in_memory: `int`, optional (default = `None`)
        If not specified, all instances will be read and cached in memory for the duration
        of the data loader's life. This is generally ideal when your data can fit in memory
        during training. However, when you're datasets are too big, using this option
        will turn on lazy loading, where only `max_instances_in_memory` instances are processed
        at a time.

        Note that this setting will affect how a `batch_sampler` is applied. If
        `max_instances_in_memory` is `None`, the sampler will be applied to all `Instance`s.
        Otherwise the sampler will be applied to only `max_instances_in_memory` `Instance`s
        at a time.

    start_method: `str`, optional (default = `"fork"`)
        The [start method](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods)
        used to spin up workers.

    instance_queue_size: `int`, optional (default = `1000`)
        This determines the size of the
        [multiprocessing queue](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue)
        used to pass `Instance`s from worker processes to the consuming process when
        `num_workers > 0`.

        The default value should be reasonable for most use-cases.

    instance_chunk_size: `int`, optional (default = `10`)
        This determines how many `Instance`s are sent through the instance queue
        at a time when `num_workers > 0`.

        The default value should be reasonable for most use-cases.

    batch_queue_size: `int`, optional (default = `1000`)
        This determines the size of the of the
        [multiprocessing queue](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue)
        used to pass `TensorDict` batches to the consuming process when `num_workers > 0`.

        The default value should be reasonable for most use-cases.

    batch_chunk_size: `int`, optional (default = `10`)
        This determines how many `TensorDict`s are sent through the batch queue at a time
        when `num_workers > 0`.

        The default value should be reasonable for most use-cases.


    !!! Note
        In a typical AllenNLP configuration file, the `reader` and `data_path` parameters don't
        get an entry under the "data_loader". The `reader` is constructed separately from
        the corresponding `dataset_reader` params, and the `data_path` is taken from the
        `train_data_path`, `validation_data_path`, or `test_data_path`.
