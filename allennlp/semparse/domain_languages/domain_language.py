    A ``DomainLanguage`` specifies the functions available to use for a semantic parsing task.  You
    write execution code for these functions, and we will automatically induce a grammar from those
    functions and give you a lisp interpreter that can use those functions.  For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        class Arithmetic(DomainLanguage):
            @predicate
            def add(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:

            @predicate
            def halve(self, num: int) -> int:
                return num / 2

            ...

    Instantiating this class now gives you a language object that can parse and execute logical
    forms, can convert logical forms to action sequences (linearized abstract syntax trees) and
    back again, and can list all valid production rules in a grammar induced from the specified
    functions.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> l = Arithmetic()
        >>> l.execute("(add 2 3)")
        5
        >>> l.execute("(halve (add 12 4))")
        8
        >>> l.logical_form_to_action_sequence("(add 2 3)")
        # See the docstring for this function for an description of what these strings mean.
        ['@start@ -> int', 'int -> [<int,int:int>, int, int]', '<int,int:int> -> add',
         'int -> 2', 'int -> 3']
        >>> l.action_sequence_to_logical_form(l.logical_form_to_action_sequence('(add 2 3)'))
        '(add 2 3)'
        >>> l.get_nonterminal_productions()
        {'<int,int:int>': ['add', 'divide', 'multiply', 'subtract'], '<int:int>': ['halve'], ...}

    This is done with some reflection magic, with the help of the ``@predicate`` decorator and type
    annotations.  For a method you define on a ``DomainLanguage`` subclass to be included in the
    language, it *must* be decorated with ``@predicate``, and it *must* have type annotations on
    all arguments and on its return type.  You can also add predicates and constants to the
    language using the :func:`add_predicate` and :func:`add_constant` functions, if you choose
    (minor point: constants with generic types (like ``Set[int]``) must currently be specified as
    predicates, as the ``allowed_constants`` dictionary doesn't pass along the generic type
    information).

    The language we construct is purely functional - no defining variables or using lambda
    functions, or anything like that.  If you would like to extend this code to handle more complex
    languages, open an issue on github.

    We have rudimentary support for class hierarchies in the types that you provide.  This is done
    through adding constants multiple times with different types.  For example, say you have a
    ``Column`` class with ``NumberColumn`` and ``StringColumn`` subclasses.  You can have functions
    that take the base class ``Column`` as an argument, and other functions that take the
    subclasses.  These will get types like ``<List[Row],Column:List[str]>`` (for a "select"
    function that returns whatever cell text is in that column for the given rows), and
    ``<List[Row],NumberColumn,Number:List[Row]>`` (for a "greater_than" function that returns rows
    with a value in the column greater than the given number).  These will generate argument types
    of ``Column`` and ``NumberColumn``, respectively.  ``NumberColumn`` is a subclass of
    ``Column``, so we want the ``Column`` production to include all ``NumberColumns`` as options.
    This is done by calling ``add_constant()`` with each ``NumberColumn`` twice: once without a
    ``type_`` argument (which infers the type as ``NumberColumn``), and once with ``type_=Column``.
    You can see a concrete example of how this works in the
    :class:`~allennlp.semparse.domain_languages.wikitables_language.WikiTablesLanguage`.
