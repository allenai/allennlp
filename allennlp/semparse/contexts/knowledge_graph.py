class KnowledgeGraph:
    """
    A ``KnowledgeGraph`` represents a collection of entities and their relationships.

    The ``KnowledgeGraph`` currently stores (untyped) neighborhood information and text
    representations of each entity (if there is any).

    The knowledge base itself can be a table (like in WikitableQuestions), a figure (like in NLVR)
    or some other structured knowledge source. This abstract class needs to be inherited for
    implementing the functionality appropriate for a given KB.

    All of the parameters listed below are stored as public attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    entities : ``Set[str]``
        The string identifiers of the entities in this knowledge graph.  We sort this set and store
        it as a list.  The sorting is so that we get a guaranteed consistent ordering across
        separate runs of the code.
    neighbors : ``Dict[str, List[str]]``
        A mapping from string identifiers to other string identifiers, denoting which entities are
        neighbors in the graph.
    entity_text : ``Dict[str, str]``
        If you have additional text associated with each entity (other than its string identifier),
        you can store that here.  This might be, e.g., the text in a table cell, or the description
        of a wikipedia entity.
