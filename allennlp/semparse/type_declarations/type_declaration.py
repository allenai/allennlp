"""
This module defines some classes that are generally useful for defining a type system for a new
domain. We inherit the type logic in ``nltk.sem.logic`` and add some functionality on top of it
here. There are two main improvements:
1) Firstly, we allow defining multiple basic types with their own names (see ``NamedBasicType``).
2) Secondly, we allow defining function types that have placeholders in them (see
``PlaceholderType``).
We also extend NLTK's ``LogicParser`` to define a ``DynamicTypeLogicParser`` that knows how to deal
with the two improvements above.

    ``PlaceholderType`` is a ``ComplexType`` that involves placeholders, and thus its type
    resolution is context sensitive. This is an abstract class for all placeholder types like
    reverse, and, or, argmax, etc.

    Note that ANY_TYPE in NLTK's type system doesn't work like a wild card. Once the type of a
    variable gets resolved to a specific type, NLTK changes the type of that variable to that
    specific type. Hence, what NLTK calls "ANY_TYPE", is essentially a "yet-to-be-decided" type.
    This is a problem because we may want the same variable to bind to different types within a
    logical form, and using ANY_TYPE for this purpose will cause a resolution failure. For example
    the count function may apply to both rows and cells in the same logical form, and making count
    of type ``ComplexType(ANY_TYPE, DATE_NUM_TYPE)`` will cause a resolution error. This class lets
    you define ``ComplexType`` s with placeholders that are actually wild cards.

    The subclasses of this abstract class need to do three things
    1) Override the property ``_signature`` to define the type signature (this is just the
    signature's string representation and will not affect type inference or checking). You will see
    this signature in action sequences.
    2) Override ``resolve`` to resolve the type appropriately (see the docstring in ``resolve`` for
    more information).
    3) Override ``get_application_type`` which returns the return type when this type is applied as
    a function to an argument of a specified type.  For example, if you defined a reverse type by
    inheriting from this class, ``get_application_type`` gets an argument of type ``<a,b>``, it
    should return ``<b,a>`` .

        This method is central to type inference and checking. When a variable's type is being
        checked, we compare what we know of its type against what is expected of its type by its
        context. The expectation is provided as ``other``. We make sure that there are no
        contradictions between this type and other, and return an updated type which may be more
        specific than the original type.

        For example, say this type is of the function variable F in F(cell), and we start out with
        ``<?, d>`` (that is, it takes any type and returns ``d`` ). Now we have already resolved
        cell to be of type ``e`` . Then ``resolve`` gets called with ``other = <e, ?>`` , because
        we know F is a function that took a constant of type ``e`` . When we resolve ``<e, ?>``
        against ``<?, d>`` , there will not be a contradiction, because any type can be
        successfully resolved against ``?`` . Finally we return ``<e, d>`` as the resolved type.

        As a counter example, if we are trying to resolve ``<?, d>`` against ``<?, e>`` , the
        resolution fails, and in that case, this method returns ``None`` .

        Note that a successful resolution does not imply equality of types because of one of them

        signature for it. Setting this flag to True adds the mapping to `common_name_mapping`.

    """
    Generates all the valid actions starting from each non-terminal. For terminals of a specific
    type, we simply add a production from the type to the terminal. For all terminal `functions`,
    we additionally add a rule that allows their return type to be generated from an application of
    the function.  For example, the function ``<e,<r,<d,r>>>``, which takes three arguments and
    returns an ``r`` would generate a the production rule ``r -> [<e,<r,<d,r>>>, e, r, d]``.

    For functions that do not contain ANY_TYPE or placeholder types, this is straight-forward.
    When there are ANY_TYPES or placeholders, we substitute the ANY_TYPE with all possible basic
    types, and then produce a similar rule.  For example, the identity function, with type
    ``<#1,#1>`` and basic types ``e`` and ``r``,  would produce the rules ``e -> [<#1,#1>, e]`` and
    ``r -> [<#1,#1>, r]``.

    We additionally add a valid action from the start symbol to all ``valid_starting_types``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name_mapping : ``Dict[str, str]``
        The mapping of names that appear in your logical form languages to their aliases for NLTK.
        If you are getting all valid actions for a type declaration, this can be the
        ``COMMON_NAME_MAPPING``.
    type_signatures : ``Dict[str, Type]``
        The mapping from name aliases to their types. If you are getting all valid actions for a
        type declaration, this can be the ``COMMON_TYPE_SIGNATURE``.
    basic_types : ``Set[Type]``
        Set of all basic types in the type declaration.
    valid_starting_types : ``Set[Type]``, optional
        These are the valid starting types for your grammar; e.g., what types are we allowed to
        parse expressions into?  We will add a "START -> TYPE" rule for each of these types.  If
        this is ``None``, we default to using ``basic_types``.
    num_nested_lambdas : ``int`` (optional)
        Does the language used permit lambda expressions?  And if so, how many nested lambdas do we
        need to worry about?  We'll add rules like "<r,d> -> ['lambda x', d]" for all complex
        types, where the variable is determined by the number of nestings.  We currently only
        permit up to three levels of nesting, just for ease of implementation.
