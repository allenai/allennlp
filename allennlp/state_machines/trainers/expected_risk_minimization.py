class ExpectedRiskMinimization(DecoderTrainer[Callable[[StateType], torch.Tensor]]):
    """
    This class implements a trainer that minimizes the expected value of a cost function over the
    space of some candidate sequences produced by a decoder. We generate the candidate sequences by
    performing beam search (which is one of the two popular ways of getting these sequences, the
    other one being sampling; see "Classical Structured Prediction Losses for Sequence to Sequence
    Learning" by Edunov et al., 2017 for more details).

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_size : ``int``
    noramlize_by_length : ``bool``
        Should the log probabilities be normalized by length before renormalizing them? Edunov et
        al. do this in their work.
    max_decoding_steps : ``int``
        The maximum number of steps we should take during decoding.
    max_num_decoded_sequences : ``int``, optional (default=1)
        Maximum number of sorted decoded sequences to return. Defaults to 1.
    max_num_finished_states : ``int``, optional (default = None)
        Maximum number of finished states to keep after search. This is to finished states as
        ``beam_size`` is to unfinished ones. Costs are computed for only these number of states per
        instance. If not set, we will keep all the finished states.
