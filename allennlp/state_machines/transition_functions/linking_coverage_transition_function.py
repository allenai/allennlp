class LinkingCoverageTransitionFunction(CoverageTransitionFunction):
    """
    Combines both linking and coverage on top of the ``BasicTransitionFunction`` (which is just an
    LSTM decoder with attention).  This adds the ability to consider `linked` actions in addition
    to global (embedded) actions, and it adds a coverage penalty over the `output action sequence`,
    combining the :class:`LinkingTransitionFunction` with the :class:`CoverageTransitionFunction`.

    The one thing that's unique to this class is how the coverage penalty interacts with linked
    actions.  Instead of boosting the action's embedding, as we do in the
    ``CoverageTransitionFunction``, we boost the action's logit directly (as there is no action
    embedding for linked actions).

    Parameters
    ----------
    encoder_output_dim : ``int``
    action_embedding_dim : ``int``
    input_attention : ``Attention``
    activation : ``Activation``, optional (default=relu)
        The activation that gets applied to the decoder LSTM input and to the action query.
    predict_start_type_separately : ``bool``, optional (default=True)
        If ``True``, we will predict the initial action (which is typically the base type of the
        logical form) using a different mechanism than our typical action decoder.  We basically
        just do a projection of the hidden state, and don't update the decoder RNN.
    num_start_types : ``int``, optional (default=None)
        If ``predict_start_type_separately`` is ``True``, this is the number of start types that
        are in the grammar.  We need this so we can construct parameters with the right shape.
        This is unused if ``predict_start_type_separately`` is ``False``.
    add_action_bias : ``bool``, optional (default=True)
        If ``True``, there has been a bias dimension added to the embedding of each action, which
        gets used when predicting the next action.  We add a dimension of ones to our predicted
        action vector in this case to account for that.
    dropout : ``float`` (optional, default=0.0)
