class BeamSearch(FromParams, Generic[StateType]):
    """
    This class implements beam search over transition sequences given an initial ``State`` and a
    ``TransitionFunction``, returning the highest scoring final states found by the beam (the
    states will keep track of the transition sequence themselves).

    The initial ``State`` is assumed to be `batched`.  The value we return from the search is a
    dictionary from batch indices to ranked finished states.

    IMPORTANT: We assume that the ``TransitionFunction`` that you are using returns possible next
    states in sorted order, so we do not do an additional sort inside of ``BeamSearch.search()``.
    If you're implementing your own ``TransitionFunction``, you must ensure that you've sorted the
    states that you return.

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_size : ``int``
        The beam size to use.
    per_node_beam_size : ``int``, optional (default = beam_size)
        The maximum number of candidates to consider per node, at each step in the search.
        If not given, this just defaults to `beam_size`. Setting this parameter
        to a number smaller than `beam_size` may give better results, as it can introduce
        more diversity into the search. See Freitag and Al-Onaizan 2017,
        "Beam Search Strategies for Neural Machine Translation".
    initial_sequence : ``torch.Tensor``, optional (default = None)
        If you provide a (sequence_length,) tensor here, the beam search will be constrained
        to only sequences that begin with the provided initial_sequence.
    keep_beam_details : ``bool``, optional (default = False)
        If True, we store snapshots of each beam in an instance variable ``beam_snapshots``,
        which is a dict: { batch_index -> [timestep0_histories, ..., timestepk_histories] },
        where a "timestep history" is just a pair (score, action_history) that was considered
        at that timestep.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_steps : ``int``
            How many steps should we take in our search?  This is an upper bound, as it's possible
            for the search to run out of valid actions before hitting this number, or for all
            states on the beam to finish.
        initial_state : ``StateType``
            The starting state of our search.  This is assumed to be `batched`, and our beam search
            is batch-aware - we'll keep ``beam_size`` states around for each instance in the batch.
        transition_function : ``TransitionFunction``
            The ``TransitionFunction`` object that defines and scores transitions from one state to the
            next.
        keep_final_unfinished_states : ``bool``, optional (default=True)
            If we run out of steps before a state is "finished", should we return that state in our
