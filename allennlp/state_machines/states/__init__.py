"""
This module contains the ``State`` abstraction for defining state-machine-based decoders, and some
pre-built concrete ``State`` classes for various kinds of decoding (e.g., a ``GrammarBasedState``
for doing grammar-based decoding, where the output is a sequence of production rules from a
grammar).

The module also has some ``Statelet`` classes to help represent the ``State`` by grouping together
related pieces, including ``RnnStatelet``, which you can use to keep track of a decoder RNN's
internal state, ``GrammarStatelet``, which keeps track of what actions are allowed at each timestep
of decoding (if your outputs are production rules from a grammar), and ``ChecklistStatelet`` that
keeps track of coverage information if you are training a coverage-based parser.
