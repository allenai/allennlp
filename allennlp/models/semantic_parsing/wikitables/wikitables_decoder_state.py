    Parameters
    ----------
    batch_indices : ``List[int]``
        Passed to super class; see docs there.
    action_history : ``List[List[int]]``
        Passed to super class; see docs there.
    score : ``List[torch.Tensor]``
        Passed to super class; see docs there.
    rnn_state : ``List[RnnState]``
        An ``RnnState`` for every group element.  This keeps track of the current decoder hidden
        state, the previous decoder output, the output from the encoder (for computing attentions),
        and other things that are typical seq2seq decoder state things.
    grammar_state : ``List[GrammarState]``
        This hold the current grammar state for each element of the group.  The ``GrammarState``
        keeps track of which actions are currently valid.
    action_embeddings : ``torch.Tensor``
        The global action embeddings tensor.  Has shape ``(num_global_embeddable_actions,
        action_embedding_dim)``.
    action_indices : ``Dict[Tuple[int, int], int]``
        A mapping from ``(batch_index, action_index)`` to ``global_action_index``.
    possible_actions : ``List[List[ProductionRuleArray]]``
        The list of all possible actions that was passed to ``model.forward()``.  We need this so
        we can recover production strings, which we need to update grammar states.
    flattened_linking_scores : ``torch.FloatTensor``
        Linking scores between table entities and question tokens.  The unflattened version has
        shape ``(batch_size, num_entities, num_question_tokens)``, though this version is flattened
        to have shape ``(batch_size * num_entities, num_question_tokens)``, for easier lookups with
        ``index_select``.
    actions_to_entities : ``Dict[Tuple[int, int], int]``
        A mapping from ``(batch_index, action_index)`` to ``batch_size * num_entities``, for
        actions that are terminal entity productions.
    entity_types : ``Dict[int, int]``
        A mapping from flattened entity indices (same as the `values` in the
        ``actions_to_entities`` dictionary) to entity type indices.  This represents what type each
        entity has, which we will use for getting type embeddings in certain circumstances.
