    """
    This abstract class represents a model to be trained. Rather than relying completely
    on the Pytorch Module, we modify the output spec of `forward` to be a dictionary.

    Models built using this API are still compatible with other pytorch models and can
    be used naturally as modules within other models - outputs are dictionaries, which
    can be unpacked and passed into other layers. One caveat to this is that if you
    wish to use an AllenNLP model inside a Container (such as nn.Sequential), you must
    interleave the models with a wrapper module which unpacks the dictionary into
    a list of tensors.

    In order for your model to be trained using the [`Trainer`](../training/trainer.md)
    api, the output dictionary of your Model must include a "loss" key, which will be
    optimised during the training process.

    Finally, you can optionally implement :func:`Model.get_metrics` in order to make use
    of early stopping and best-model serialization based on a validation metric in
    `Trainer`. Metrics that begin with "_" will not be logged
    to the progress bar by `Trainer`.

    # Parameters

    vocab: `Vocabulary`
        There are two typical use-cases for the `Vocabulary` in a `Model`: getting vocabulary sizes
        when constructing embedding matrices or output classifiers (as the vocabulary holds the
        number of classes in your output, also), and translating model output into human-readable
        form.
    regularizer: `RegularizerApplicator`, optional
        If given, the `Trainer` will use this to regularize model parameters.

        Defines the forward pass of the model. In addition, to facilitate easy training,
        this method is designed to compute a loss function defined by a user.

        The input is comprised of everything required to perform a
        training update, `including` labels - you define the signature here!
        It is down to the user to ensure that inference can be performed
        without the presence of these labels. Hence, any inputs not available at
        inference time should only be used inside a conditional block.

        The intended sketch of this method is as follows::

            def forward(self, input1, input2, targets=None):
                ....

            Tensors comprising everything needed to perform a training update, `including` labels,
            which should be optional (i.e have a default value of `None`).  At inference time,
            simply pass the relevant inputs, not including the labels.
