        This method goes through all of the actions from ``state.get_valid_actions()`` and
        separates them into actions that can be embedded and actions that need to be linked, based
        on the action's ``global_action_index`` (all embeddable actions have an action index lower

            `interior` padding in between the embedded actions and the linked actions where
            necessary.  The ``action_index`` for padded entries is -1.  This padding replicates the

        type of the entity produced by the action.

        The ``actions_to_link`` are in terms of the `batch` action list passed to
        ``model.forward()``.  We need to convert these integers into indices into the linking score
        tensor, which has shape (batch_size, num_entities, num_question_tokens), look up the
        linking score for each entity, then aggregate the scores using the current question
        attention.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : ``WikiTablesDecoderState``
            The current state.  We'll use this to get the linking scores.
        actions_to_link : ``List[List[int]]``
            A list of _batch_ action indices for each group element.  Should have shape
            (group_size, num_actions), unpadded.  This is expected to be output from
            :func:`_get_actions_to_consider`.
        attention_weights : ``torch.Tensor``
            The current attention weights over the question tokens.  Should have shape
            ``(group_size, num_question_tokens)``.

        Returns
        -------
        action_logits : ``torch.FloatTensor``
            A score for each of the given actions.  Shape is ``(group_size, num_actions)``, where
            ``num_actions`` is the maximum number of considered actions for any group element.
        action_mask : ``torch.LongTensor``
            A mask of shape ``(group_size, num_actions)`` indicating which ``(group_index,
            action_index)`` pairs were merely added as padding.
        type_embeddings : ``torch.LongTensor``
            A tensor of shape ``(group_size, num_actions, action_embedding_dim)``, with an embedded
            representation of the `type` of the entity corresponding to each action.
