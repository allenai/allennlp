        This function finds a modification to the input text that would change the model's
        prediction in some desired manner (e.g., an adversarial attack).

        Parameters
        ----------
        inputs : ``JsonDict``
            The input you want to attack (the same as the argument to a Predictor, e.g.,
            predict_json()).
        input_field_to_attack : ``str``
            The key in the inputs JsonDict you want to attack, e.g., ``tokens``.
        grad_input_field : ``str``
            The field in the gradients dictionary that contains the input gradients.  For example,
            `grad_input_1` will be the field for single input tasks. See get_gradients() in
            `Predictor` for more information on field names.
        target : ``JsonDict``
            If given, this is a `targeted` attack, trying to change the prediction to a particular
            value, instead of just changing it from its original prediction.  Subclasses are not
            required to accept this argument, as not all attacks make sense as targeted attacks.
            Perhaps that means we should make the API more crisp, but adding another class is not
            worth it.

        Returns
        -------
        reduced_input : ``JsonDict``
            Contains the final, sanitized input after adversarial modification.
