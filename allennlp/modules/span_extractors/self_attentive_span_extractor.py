    """
    Computes span representations by generating an unnormalized attention score for each
    word in the document. Spans representations are computed with respect to these
    scores by normalising the attention scores for words inside the span.

    Given these attention distributions over every span, this module weights the
    corresponding vector representations of the words in the span by this distribution,
    returning a weighted representation of each span.

    # Parameters

    input_dim : `int`, required.
        The final dimension of the `sequence_tensor`.

    # Returns

    attended_text_embeddings : `torch.FloatTensor`.
        A tensor of shape (batch_size, num_spans, input_dim), which each span representation
        is formed by locally normalising a global attention over the sequence. The only way
        in which the attention distribution differs over different spans is in the set of words
        over which they are normalized.
