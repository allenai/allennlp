    A ``Seq2SeqEncoder`` is a ``Module`` that takes as input a sequence of vectors and returns a
    modified sequence of vectors.  Input shape: ``(batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim)``; output
    shape: ``(batch_size, sequence_length, output_dim)``.

    We add two methods to the basic ``Module`` API: :func:`get_input_dim()` and :func:`get_output_dim()`.

    or to raise sensible errors for mis-matching input dimensions.
