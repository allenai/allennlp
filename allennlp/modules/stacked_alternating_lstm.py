class StackedAlternatingLstm(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    A stacked LSTM with LSTM layers which alternate between going forwards over
    the sequence and going backwards. This implementation is based on the
    description in `Deep Semantic Role Labelling - What works and what's next
    <https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luheng/files/acl2017_hllz.pdf>`_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_size : int, required
        The dimension of the inputs to the LSTM.
    hidden_size : int, required
        The dimension of the outputs of the LSTM.
    num_layers : int, required
        The number of stacked LSTMs to use.
    recurrent_dropout_probability: float, optional (default = 0.0)
        The dropout probability to be used in a dropout scheme as stated in
        `A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks
        <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287>`_ .
    use_input_projection_bias : bool, optional (default = True)
        Whether or not to use a bias on the input projection layer. This is mainly here
        for backwards compatibility reasons and will be removed (and set to False)
        in future releases.

    Returns
    -------
    output_accumulator : PackedSequence
        The outputs of the interleaved LSTMs per timestep. A tensor of shape
        (batch_size, max_timesteps, hidden_size) where for a given batch
        element, all outputs past the sequence length for that batch are
        zero tensors.
