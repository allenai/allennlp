class ElmoLstm(_EncoderBase):
    """
    A stacked, bidirectional LSTM which uses
    :class:`~allennlp.modules.lstm_cell_with_projection.LstmCellWithProjection`'s
    with highway layers between the inputs to layers.
    The inputs to the forward and backward directions are independent - forward and backward
    states are not concatenated between layers.

    Additionally, this LSTM maintains its `own` state, which is updated every time
    ``forward`` is called. It is dynamically resized for different batch sizes and is
    designed for use with non-continuous inputs (i.e inputs which aren't formatted as a stream,
    such as text used for a language modelling task, which is how stateful RNNs are typically used).
    This is non-standard, but can be thought of as having an "end of sentence" state, which is
    carried across different sentences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_size : ``int``, required
        The dimension of the inputs to the LSTM.
    hidden_size : ``int``, required
        The dimension of the outputs of the LSTM.
    cell_size : ``int``, required.
        The dimension of the memory cell of the
        :class:`~allennlp.modules.lstm_cell_with_projection.LstmCellWithProjection`.
    num_layers : ``int``, required
        The number of bidirectional LSTMs to use.
    requires_grad: ``bool``, optional
        If True, compute gradient of ELMo parameters for fine tuning.
    recurrent_dropout_probability: ``float``, optional (default = 0.0)
        The dropout probability to be used in a dropout scheme as stated in
        `A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks
        <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287>`_ .
    state_projection_clip_value: ``float``, optional, (default = None)
        The magnitude with which to clip the hidden_state after projecting it.
    memory_cell_clip_value: ``float``, optional, (default = None)
        The magnitude with which to clip the memory cell.
