    ``MatrixAttention`` takes two matrices as input and returns a matrix of attentions.

    We compute the similarity between each row in each matrix and return unnormalized similarity
    scores.  Because these scores are unnormalized, we don't take a mask as input; it's up to the
    caller to deal with masking properly when this output is used.

    Input:
        - matrix_1: ``(batch_size, num_rows_1, embedding_dim_1)``
        - matrix_2: ``(batch_size, num_rows_2, embedding_dim_2)``
