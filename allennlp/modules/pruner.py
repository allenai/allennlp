class Pruner(torch.nn.Module):

    This module scores and prunes items in a list using a parameterised scoring function and a
    threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scorer : ``torch.nn.Module``, required.
        A module which, given a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_items, embedding_size),
        produces a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_items, 1), representing a scalar score
        per item in the tensor.

        """
        Extracts the top-k scoring items with respect to the scorer. We additionally return
        the indices of the top-k in their original order, not ordered by score, so that downstream
        components can rely on the original ordering (e.g., for knowing what spans are valid
        antecedents in a coreference resolution model). May use the same k for all sentences in
        minibatch, or different k for each.

        Parameters
        ----------
        embeddings : ``torch.FloatTensor``, required.
            A tensor of shape (batch_size, num_items, embedding_size), containing an embedding for
            each item in the list that we want to prune.
        mask : ``torch.LongTensor``, required.
            A tensor of shape (batch_size, num_items), denoting unpadded elements of
            ``embeddings``.
        num_items_to_keep : ``Union[int, torch.LongTensor]``, required.
            If a tensor of shape (batch_size), specifies the number of items to keep for each
            individual sentence in minibatch.
            If an int, keep the same number of items for all sentences.

        Returns
        -------
        top_embeddings : ``torch.FloatTensor``
            The representations of the top-k scoring items.
            Has shape (batch_size, max_num_items_to_keep, embedding_size).
        top_mask : ``torch.LongTensor``
            The corresponding mask for ``top_embeddings``.
            Has shape (batch_size, max_num_items_to_keep).
        top_indices : ``torch.IntTensor``
            The indices of the top-k scoring items into the original ``embeddings``
            tensor. This is returned because it can be useful to retain pointers to
            the original items, if each item is being scored by multiple distinct
            scorers, for instance. Has shape (batch_size, max_num_items_to_keep).
        top_item_scores : ``torch.FloatTensor``
            The values of the top-k scoring items.
            Has shape (batch_size, max_num_items_to_keep, 1).
