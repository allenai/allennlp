I remembered when this piece of crap premiered, I heard the good people of Nashville were mad as hell at the obvious insult to their city and state. So I went to see it just to see if they were over reacting. They weren't. Altman and his ilk, think all of us who live in the \"fly over\" states are a bunch of backward rubes who just don't get it, cause we vote republican. <br /><br />The casting was a joke, and the music worse. This was Hollywood country. This had nothing to do with Nashville or the country music culture. This was Country as seen through the eyes of the Hollywood culture. Why cast a bunch of yankees and west coast \"progressives\" to portray southerners, unless you're satirizing them. All I saw was a bunch of second rate actors dressed up as clowns, pokin fun at the backward hillbillies of Tennessee.<br /><br />Just as M*A*S*H was a jab at the military culture, Nashville was no more than a laugh at the country music culture of the South. So yuk it up while you can. Hollywood and the mainstream media won't always wield the power of influence over our culture."}

Along with Murder on the Orient Express and Cactus Flower, this is the only other movie I ever walked out of the theater on. My wife came with me to see the movie for something to do. She agreed that it sucked and that we should leave the theater, to do more important things, such as watch the linoleum curl on the kitchen floor. Hey, at least that had some suspense in it. Do yourself a favor, and rent Road Trip or Harold and Kumar instead, they were funny and entertaining, this was artsy stupid crap. Since I have nothing else to say and there is a ten line minimum, I just want to say that this thing stunk."}
