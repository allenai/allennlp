{"text":"anyone who saw alan rickman 's finely - realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor - turned - director is a bit of a poet at heart .\nhowever , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock .\nnevertheless , \" poetic \" is an excellent term to describe rickman 's feature debut as a director , the winter guest .\nthe film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole .\nthe result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama .\nthe winter guest is n't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it 's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages .\nthe winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ?\nthere is no real beginning or end .\ninstead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans .\nthey represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ?\nmale and female ; young , middle - aged , and elderly ; friends , would - be lovers , and kin .\nwe see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled .\nthere is comedy and tragedy .\nmost importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ?\nin this fiction can be found much truth .\nthe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year .\nit 's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over .\nthe onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance .\nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured .\nthere are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest 's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship .\nthe first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently - widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) .\nthese two have a stormy relationship .\nthey love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other .\nmuch of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other .\nfrances ' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father .\non this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks .\nalthough their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction .\nonce they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things do n't go exactly as planned .\nlily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees .\ndeath is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area .\nit does n't matter whether or not they knew the deceased .\nit 's the ceremony that they 're interested in .\nsam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water .\nunlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them .\nthey are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience .\nthe acting is strong and believable .\nthe mixture of veteran performers and first - timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real - life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles .\nthere is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non - related actors .\nand , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child .\nthe winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director .\nfour of the film 's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film .\nunlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up .\nthe rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans .\nin fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman 's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie .\nif you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .","label":"POS"}

{"text":"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned .\nthe teaser trailers for my best friend 's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light - hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i 'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often .\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend 's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic - comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms .\nroberts .\nthe heroine of my best friend 's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex - lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both had n't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other .\nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael 's age , julianne realizes that he 's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day .\nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael 's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary .\nthe setup for my best friend 's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film 's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p .\nj .\nhogan , whose first feature , muriel 's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly - duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend 's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic - comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour .\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr .\nhogan .\nfor example , there 's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background .\nmy best friend 's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect\n- it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen 's everyone says i love you ; i 'd even assert it 's a more successful one .\nmy best friend 's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well .\nin a typical romantic - comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy 's life , she 'd actually like her too .\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend 's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality .\nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic - comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion .\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well - paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we 're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments .\nmy best friend 's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top - notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne .\nthis is n't the sort of role one usually associates with ms .\nroberts - the julianne character 's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms .\nroberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable .\neven better than ms .\nroberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend 's weddding .\nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy 's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film .\nshe even sings\n- i wo n't soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just do n't know what to do with myself \" .\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film .\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr .\neverett 's performance is a delight to watch ; he 's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous .\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he 's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms .\nroberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic .\nwhen julia roberts ' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america 's sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and\neveryone says i love you to raise her profile .\nwhile that did n't quite work out , it 's near - certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic - comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game .\nmy best friend 's wedding marks a return to form for ms .\nroberts , and cements\np .\nj .\nhogan 's reputation as a skilled director of comedy .","label":"POS"}

thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) ,\nthe acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters .\nyes , you read that right .\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! if you do n't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this\ncan be .\nif you 've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story .\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film .\nso , it 's up to the u\n. s .\ngovernment to stop it .\n( why the u . s .\nis always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . )\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within .\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) .\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a .\nj .\n( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) .\nthere 's also an interesting triangle formed between a .\nj . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry 's daughter .\na .\nj .\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad is n't too happy with the situation .\nit 's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or\nwhatever it is you 'd like to call armageddon .\nit 's not about story -- it 's about viscera and action , and thrills - a - minute , and all that stuff .\nit 's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds ' thought to what actually happens .\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film\nso entertaining and so visually sharp\nthat i doubt any director could have done it better .\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles .\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york .\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars .\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways .\ni like his quick - edit style , because it 's abrasive and exhausting to watch .\nit 's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times .\nbut it 's fun to be obnoxious sometimes .\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame .\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable .\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they 're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film does n't work .\neverything here looks bright and explosive\n-- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid .\nthe effects that do n't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster\nso nice - looking that it actually qualifies as art\n.\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above - average light show , if i did n't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action .\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action .\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters ' subplots .\ni wo n't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions are n't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way .\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that 's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel - good parts of its story .\nbruce willis is terrific , and i 'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) .\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level .\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex - wife and son is very moving\n.\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny\n.\ni was n't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i do n't mind too much .\nbut the film does n't insult my intelligence -- it 's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do .\nit 's not mindless and escapist , but well - crafted cinema .\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget .\ni 'm not saying that films like this are risky moves .\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .","label":"POS"}
{"text":"it 's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office .\na poorly - written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well - written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs .\nin directing his latest action - comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get - out buddy cop movie .\nin addition , rush hour serves as a first - class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types .\nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together .\njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts .\nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one .\nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there 's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who could n't believe their eyes the first time .\nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan 's performance .\nhe works perfectly with the script , and it 's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines .\nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent .\nwe 're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd .\ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters .\nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help .\nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective .\nit 's here\nthat carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up .\nrattner\ndoes a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it does n't quite reach the top tier of action - comedies like last year 's grosse pointe blank .\nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback .\nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing .\nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background .\nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it 's tucker 's toned - down routine or chan 's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types .\na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .","label":"POS"}

any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real - time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned .\nabout thirty - five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer \/ writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini - series called a for andromeda .\nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer 's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication .\nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then - unknown julie christie .\naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings .\ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well - structured movie scripts ;
