    Any class that inherits from `Registrable` gains access to a named registry for its
    subclasses. To register them, just decorate them with the classmethod
    `@BaseClass.register(name)`.

    After which you can call `BaseClass.list_available()` to get the keys for the
    registered subclasses, and `BaseClass.by_name(name)` to get the corresponding subclass.
    Note that the registry stores the subclasses themselves; not class instances.
    In most cases you would then call `from_params(params)` on the returned subclass.

    You can specify a default by setting `BaseClass.default_implementation`.
    If it is set, it will be the first element of `list_available()`.

    Note that if you use this class to implement a new `Registrable` abstract class,
    you must ensure that all subclasses of the abstract class are loaded when the module is
    loaded, because the subclasses register themselves in their respective files. You can
    achieve this by having the abstract class and all subclasses in the __init__.py of the
    module in which they reside (as this causes any import of either the abstract class or
    a subclass to load all other subclasses and the abstract class).

            The name of the method to use on the class to construct the object.  If this is given,

        # Examples

        To use this class, you would typically have a base class that inherits from `Registrable`:

        ```python
        class Vocabulary(Registrable):
            ...
        ```

        Then, if you want to register a subclass, you decorate it like this:

        ```python
        @Vocabulary.register("my-vocabulary")
        class MyVocabulary(Vocabulary):
            def __init__(self, param1: int, param2: str):
                ...
        ```

        Registering a class like this will let you instantiate a class from a config file, where you
        give `"type": "my-vocabulary"`, and keys corresponding to the parameters of the `__init__`
        method (note that for this to work, those parameters must have type annotations).

        If you want to have the instantiation from a config file call a method other than the
        constructor, either because you have several different construction paths that could be
        taken for the same object (as we do in `Vocabulary`) or because you have logic you want to
        happen before you get to the constructor (as we do in `Embedding`), you can register a
        specific `@classmethod` as the constructor to use, like this:

        ```python
        @Vocabulary.register("my-vocabulary-from-instances", constructor="from_instances")
        @Vocabulary.register("my-vocabulary-from-files", constructor="from_files")
        class MyVocabulary(Vocabulary):
            def __init__(self, some_params):
                ...

            @classmethod
            def from_instances(cls, some_other_params) -> MyVocabulary:
                ...  # construct some_params from instances
                return cls(some_params)

            @classmethod
            def from_files(cls, still_other_params) -> MyVocabulary:
                ...  # construct some_params from files
                return cls(some_params)
