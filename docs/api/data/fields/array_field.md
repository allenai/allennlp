## ArrayField
```python
ArrayField(self, array:numpy.ndarray, padding_value:int=0, dtype:numpy.dtype=<class 'numpy.float32'>) -> None
```

A class representing an array, which could have arbitrary dimensions.
A batch of these arrays are padded to the max dimension length in the batch
for each dimension.

### get_padding_lengths
```python
ArrayField.get_padding_lengths(self) -> Dict[str, int]
```

If there are things in this field that need padding, note them here.  In order to pad a
batch of instance, we get all of the lengths from the batch, take the max, and pad
everything to that length (or use a pre-specified maximum length).  The return value is a
dictionary mapping keys to lengths, like {'num_tokens': 13}.

This is always called after :func:`index`.

### as_tensor
```python
ArrayField.as_tensor(self, padding_lengths:Dict[str, int]) -> torch.Tensor
```

Given a set of specified padding lengths, actually pad the data in this field and return a
torch Tensor (or a more complex data structure) of the correct shape.  We also take a
couple of parameters that are important when constructing torch Tensors.

Parameters
----------
padding_lengths : ``Dict[str, int]``
    This dictionary will have the same keys that were produced in
    :func:`get_padding_lengths`.  The values specify the lengths to use when padding each
    relevant dimension, aggregated across all instances in a batch.

### empty_field
```python
ArrayField.empty_field(self)
```

So that ``ListField`` can pad the number of fields in a list (e.g., the number of answer
option ``TextFields``), we need a representation of an empty field of each type.  This
returns that.  This will only ever be called when we're to the point of calling
:func:`as_tensor`, so you don't need to worry about ``get_padding_lengths``,
``count_vocab_items``, etc., being called on this empty field.

We make this an instance method instead of a static method so that if there is any state
in the Field, we can copy it over (e.g., the token indexers in ``TextField``).
