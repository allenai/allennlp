# Library dependencies for the python code.  You need to install these with
# `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you can run this.
# NOTE: all essential packages must be placed under a section named 'ESSENTIAL ...'
# so that the script `./scripts/check_requirements_and_setup.py` can find them.
