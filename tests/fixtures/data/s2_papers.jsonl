On the basis of the way these constraints interact with the other knowledge sources, we draw some general conclusions about the role of domain-specific information, top-down and bottom-up discourse information flow, and the usefulness of formalisation in discourse theory. Introduct ion: T i m e S w i t c h i n g and A m e l i o r a t i o n Two essential parts of discourse interpretation involve (i) determining the rhetorical role each sentence plays in the text; and (ii) determining the temporal relations between the events described. Preceding discourse context has significant effects on both of these aspects of interpretation. For example, text (1) in vacuo may be a non-iconic explanation; the pushing caused the falling and so explains why Max fell. But the same pair of sentences may receive an iconic, narrative interpretat ion in the discourse context provided by (2): John takes advantage of Max's vulnerability while he is lying the ground, to push him over the edge of the cliff. (1) Max fell. John pushed him. (2) John and Max came to the cliff's edge. John applied a sharp blow to the back of Max's neck. Max fell. John pushed him. Max rolled over the edge of the cliff. a The support of the Science and Engineering Research Council through project number GR/G22077 is gratefully acknowledged.

The goal is to find an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost of travel. The problem is known to be #P-hard. Since there has been no significant progress on approximation algorithms for several decades, we have chosen to seek out special cases for which exact solutions exist, in the hope of demonstrating techniques that could lead to further progress. Applying a mix of techniques from algorithm analysis and the theory of Markov Decision Processes, we provide efficient exact algorithms for directed acyclic graphs and (undirected) graphs of disjoint paths from source to destination with random two-valued edge costs.

The algorithm is formulated in terms of critical points which are the points where the topology of an environment changes. We developed a provably complete coverage algorithm which makes a robot pass over all possible points of an unknown environment. Overview of The Coverage Algorithm Conventional path planning determines a path between two points. This type of planning is suitable for guidance, pick and place operations etc.. Applications such as vacuum cleaning, floor scrubbing, area surveying, demining (Land & Choset 1998) and harvesting (Ollis & Stentz 1996) require more than point to point planning. They require a coverage algorithm which determines a path that passes the robot over all possible points in an environment. In many scenarios, the robot may not know its environment a priori, and thus a sensor based coverage algorithm is necessary. Sensor based coverage determines a path for a robot such that it passes over all possible points in an unknown environment. Completeness of such a coverage algorithm is of utmost importance. As an example, all possible points of a minefield should be covered to guarantee not to miss a single mine. Different types of coverage algorithms were developed by several researchers. Some of the algorithms are grid based (Zelinsky et al. 1993), (Pirzadeh Snyder 1990) and some of them are cellular decomposition based (Cao, Huang, & Hall 1988), (Vladimir J. Lumelsky & Sun 1990), (Hert, Tiwari, & Lumelsky 1996). Behavior based algorithms for coverage are also considered (MacKenzie & Balch 1996). However all these algorithms either work only in certain types of environments, make unrealistic assumptions about the sensors, or completeness of the algorithm is not shown. We developed a provably complete coverage algorithm and implemented it on a mobile platform. Cells Figure 1: Cellular Decomposition Our method is based on a geometric structure called cellular decomposition (Latombe 1991), which is the union of non-overlapping subregions of the free space, called cells. An adjacency graph encodes the topology of the cells in the environment where nodes are cells and edges connect nodes of adjacent cells (Fig. 1). Since simple back and forth motions cover each cell, complete coverage is reduced to finding an exhaustive walk through the adjacency graph (Choset & Pignon", "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1999/AAAI99-144.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1999/aaai99-144.php"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/5308c5951bc760242c31fc1c4200ff1faa4ca43c", "title": "Sensor Based Coverage of Unknown Environments for Land Mine Detection", "venue": "AI", "year": 1999}

Problems that suffer from partial observability have been modelled as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). They have been studied by researchers in Operations Research and Artificial Intelligence for the past 30 years. Nevertheless, solving for the optimal solution or for close approximations to the optimal solution is known to be NP-hard. Current algorithms are very expensive and do not scale well. Many applications can be modelled as POMDPs: quality control, autonomous robots, weapon allocation, medical diagnosis. Designing approximation algorithms to solve problems that have partial observability is the focus of this research. The model we propose (Cost Observable Markov Decision Processes or COMDPs) associates costs with obtaining information about the current state (Bayer 1998). The COMDP\u2019s actions are of two kinds: world actions and observation actions. World actions change the state of the world, but return no observation information. Observation actions return observation information, but the state of the world does not change while performing them. COMDPs are intended to model situations that arise in diagnosis and active vision where there are many observation actions that do not change the world and relatively few world-changing actions. We are particularly interested in problems where there are many alternative sensing actions (including, especially, no sensing at all) and where, if all observation actions are performed, the entire state of the world is observable (but presumably at very great cost). Hence, COMDPs can also be viewed as a form of fully observable Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the agent must pay to receive state information (they are \"cost-observable\"). Any POMDP can be modeled as a COMDP and vice versa. We want to approximately solve COMDPs and determine what POMDP classes these approximations are good for. There are two fundamental problems that any POMDP approximation algorithm must address: how to act when \"lost\" and how to avoid getting \"lost\".", "pdfUrls": ["http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/28851/Approximation%20algorithms%20for%20solving%20cost%20observable%20Markov%20decision%20process.pdf?sequence=1", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/1999/aaai99-149.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1999/AAAI99-149.pdf", "http://www.cs.orst.edu/~bayer/research/proposal.ps"], "s2Url": "http://semanticscholar.org/paper/229eb4a24a93c6e7527b11b3c37ae9776d4af485", "title": "Approximation Algorithms for Solving Cost Observable Markov Decision Processes", "venue": "AI", "year": 1999}
