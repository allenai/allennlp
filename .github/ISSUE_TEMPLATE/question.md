**Question**
Ask about something you don't understand, such as:

* How can I retrain my own ELMo language model?

* I'm working on a sentiment classification task and I would like to discard sentences that are longer than 1200 characters (my sentences vary from 400 characters to 1400+).  How can I configure my model to discard long sentences?
