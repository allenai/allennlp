# Roadmap

To better communicate with the community, we plan to share our main focuses each quarter in this
document.

# Q4 2019 (October, November, December)

We have a few major themes for this quarter:

1.  Breaking out models into their own repositories.  By doing so we hope to increase community
    engagement and ownership of these model repositories, allowing us to focus more on the core
    library.  We already have a good start on this with the following repositories:

    a.  [Semantic Parsing](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-semparse)
    
    b.  [Language Modeling](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-language-modeling)

2.  Better supporting our initiative around [Green AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10597).

    a.  Improve the performance of AllenNLP.  In particular, see the following issues:
    
        i.
        
        ii.
        
        iii.
        
    b.  Add tooling so any user can easily measure the total number of floating-point operations
    performed during training.

3.  Launching a first version of an AllenNLP course.  It's challenging for many people to onboard,
    so we're building an interactive course.  We're also designing it to be an effective resource
    for people teaching introductory NLP courses.

We're also starting to think about our 1.0 release, and have started organizing issues around [the relevant milestone](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/milestone/10).
